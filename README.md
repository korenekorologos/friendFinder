This friend finder is designed to have the user answer 10 questions. The results will be analyzed from the information from our database. The matching is done by computing the difference between each survey response and accumulating the differences. The member in the database that have the smallest difference will be presented as the closest match. The matches will be the characters from one of my favorite tv shows Girls, so go ahead see what character you relate to the most!
